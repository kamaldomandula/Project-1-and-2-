Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand and prepare data for further analysis. EDA helps uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies within datasets, providing valuable insights that guide data-driven decision-making.

Objectives
Understand the dataset and its structure.
Identify trends, patterns, and relationships.
Detect missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
Generate visualizations to summarize findings.
Prepare data for machine learning or advanced modeling.
Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key statistics of numerical and categorical variables.
Data Visualization: Creating plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.
Outlier Detection: Highlighting unusual data points.
Tools and Libraries
Python:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy for numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
plotly for interactive visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration.
Methodology
Dataset Overview:

Load and explore the dataset.
Check for data types, missing values, and duplicates.
Univariate Analysis:

Examine individual variables using summary statistics and visualizations.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:

Explore relationships between variables using correlation matrices and scatter plots.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing data and outliers.
Transform and normalize data if required.
Visualization:

Generate graphs and charts to reveal trends and patterns.
Results
Key insights and trends discovered during the analysis.
A clean and processed dataset ready for machine learning.
Visualizations that summarize data characteristics and findings.

Challenges Addressed in the Project
Handling missing and imbalanced data.
Managing large datasets with high dimensionality.
Identifying and addressing multicollinearity among features.
Balancing interpretability and depth of analysis.
Key Insights
Summarize the most valuable findings from the analysis, such as:
Distribution trends of key variables.
Correlations and dependencies between features.
Interesting anomalies or outliers.
Any feature engineering or transformations performed.
